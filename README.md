# portscaner




In this edited code, the check_port function now returns the open_port_count value, which is added up in the main function. The open_port_count value is printed after all hosts have been checked. The code also uses a dictionary to keep track of the future results, which enables us to access the corresponding IP address of each future result. Finally, the start time variable start_time is moved inside the main function to ensure that the elapsed time is measured correctly.
